# Interactive Bézier Curve with Physics & Sensor Control

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **interactive cubic Bézier curve** that behaves like a **springy rope**.  
The curve dynamically reacts to **mouse movement (Web)** or **device motion (Gyroscope)** and updates in real time using **custom physics and math logic**.

All Bézier calculations, tangent computation, and spring-damping motion are implemented **from scratch** without using any built-in animation, physics, or Bézier libraries.

##  Objective

- To understand and implement **cubic Bézier curve mathematics**
- To simulate **realistic motion** using a spring-damping physics model
- To visualize **tangent vectors** along the curve
- To handle **real-time user interaction** at 60 FPS

##  Features

- Cubic Bézier curve with **manual mathematical computation**
- **Spring-based physics** for smooth, natural motion
- **Tangent visualization** along the curve
- Dual input support:
  - Mouse interaction (Web)
  - Gyroscope input (Mobile / iOS)
- Drag-and-drop **control point manipulation**
- Real-time rendering using **HTML Canvas**
